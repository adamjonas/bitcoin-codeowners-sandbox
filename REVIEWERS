# ==============================================================================

# Configuration of code ownership and review approvals for the bitcoin/bitcoin
# repo.

# Order is important; the first matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# More info on how this file works can be found at:
# https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# This file is called CODEOWNERS because it is a magic file for GitHub to
# automatically suggest reviewers. In this project's case, the names below
# should be thought of as code reviewers rather than owners. Regular
# contributors are free to add their names to specific directories or files
# provided that they are willing to provide a review when automatically
# assigned.

# Absence from this list should not be interpreted as a discouragement to
# review a pull request. Peer review is always welcome and is a critical
# component of the progress of the codebase. Information on peer review
# guidelines can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md doc.
